      # The Revision ContainerConcurrency field specifies the maximum number
      # of requests the Container can handle at once. Container concurrency
      # target percentage is how much of that maximum to use in a stable
      # state. E.g. if a Revision specifies ContainerConcurrency of 10, then
      # the Autoscaler will try to maintain 7 concurrent connections per pod
      # on average.
      # Note: this limit will be applied to container concurrency set at every
      # level (ConfigMap, Revision Spec or Annotation).
      # For legacy and backwards compatibility reasons, this value also accepts
      # fractional values in (0, 1] interval (i.e. 0.7 ⇒ 70%).
      # Thus minimal percentage value must be greater than 1.0, or it will be
      # treated as a fraction.
      # NOTE: that this value does not affect actual number of concurrent requests
      #       the user container may receive, but only the average number of requests
      #       that the revision pods will receive.
      container-concurrency-target-percentage: "70"

      # The container concurrency target default is what the Autoscaler will
      # try to maintain when concurrency is used as the scaling metric for the
      # Revision and the Revision specifies unlimited concurrency.
      # When revision explicitly specifies container concurrency, that value
      # will be used as a scaling target for autoscaler.
      # When specifying unlimited concurrency, the autoscaler will
      # horizontally scale the application based on this target concurrency.
      # This is what we call "soft limit" in the documentation, i.e. it only
      # affects number of pods and does not affect the number of requests
      # individual pod processes.
      # The value must be a positive number such that the value multiplied
      # by container-concurrency-target-percentage is greater than 0.01.
      # NOTE: that this value will be adjusted by application of
      #       container-concurrency-target-percentage, i.e. by default

      # service is less than this setting.

      # when the revision is scaled to 0.
